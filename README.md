# record-on-retropie
Experimental shell scripts to install ffmpeg and record on retropie. 

This did not work when I tried it. However, I will leave this up in case anyone wants to try it or edit it.

Code is from http://selsine.com/2016/10/15/how-to-record-a-game-play-video-from-a-retropie/
and https://retroresolution.com/2016/05/31/compiling-software-from-source-code-on-the-raspberry-pi-the-ffmpeg-suite/
Be sure to read through those pages before proceeding.

After executing the script follow the directions at http://selsine.com/2016/10/15/how-to-record-a-game-play-video-from-a-retropie/ to mount a USB drive to record to.
